Key Features Affecting House Prices in the US (Last 20 Years)
This project explores the primary factors influencing housing prices in the United States over the past two decades. Using data analysis and machine learning, we identify and evaluate key economic, demographic, and market-related features that have impacted housing prices. The insights are derived from comprehensive datasets, including economic indicators, population trends, and real estate market statistics.

Key Features:
Median Income: A strong determinant of housing affordability and demand.
Unemployment Rate: Economic stability and job availability directly affect buying power.
Population Growth: Increases in population drive demand for housing.
Interest Rates (e.g., FEDFUNDS): Mortgage rates significantly influence housing affordability.
Number of Households: Changes in household formation impact housing supply and demand.
Construction Costs: Costs of materials and labor affect housing supply and pricing.
Consumer Price Index (CPI): Measures inflation's impact on the overall cost of living and housing affordability.
Government Subsidies: Influence affordability through financial support programs.
Demographics (e.g., Age Groups): The proportion of working-age and retired populations affects housing demand patterns.
Objective:
The goal is to analyze historical data to understand trends and develop predictive models to forecast housing prices based on these key features.
